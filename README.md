# SammyRobit
FRC Team 6644 (Atomic Automatons from Rocklin High School) code for the 2017-2018 off-season robot.

Our robot's name is Sammy, respect that. All you sappy chaps must pay reverence to thou old Sammy, even if her screws and rivets are literally falling apart every day...


# About
Despite not having a CNC'd drivebase nor nifty grabby things, Sammy has CHARACTER.
You see all those dents and scratches? Those are the results of tough trials, of hard hits, and of cataclysmic crashes. That janky Ethernet cord and unreliable radio? That's a testament to the exertion of our proud ol' Sammy, whom we hold in the highest regard.

Sammy is the culmination of a rookie team's grand efforts, and was suitably referred to as, "Super Awesome Machine Made Yesterday." Despite the outward appearance of a less-than-mediocre robot, this hunk of metal packs a punch.

Our team doesn't joke around with lights, streamers, mechanical extravagance, nor all that other flashy fluff. Sammy is a down-to-earth bot. Solidly built yet designed for speed, Sammy's minimalist construction kept a defensive play-style in mind. At yay 32 kilos, this light yet tough bot could withstand impacts that got the crowd screaming. Combined with a low center of gravity, tight turn radius, and scarily quick acceleration, Sammy successfully fulfilled her role as the most annoying defensive bot to have on the opposing team.

These traits also led to several close calls in the shop, hence the well-deserved nickname, "Ankle Destroyer." 

(Let that be your first and only warning.)

Remember that when working with Sammy, she's a feisty little yapper. When letting her run loose on her own accord, ALWAYS mount her on chairs first to see if she's in a good mood, lest she turn out to be a little cranky and attempt to take out one of our programmers. It is not advisable to sit on Sammy while she's doing her thing, although if you are so inclined, be sure not to let her jump around too much. She can be touchy at times.
